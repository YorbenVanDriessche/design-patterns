# Statement of work

Congratulations on being selected to build our next generation Internet-based Weather
Monitoring Station!

The weather station will be based on our patent pending WeatherData object, which tracks current weather conditions
(temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure). We'd like for you to create an application that initially provides three
display elements: current conditions, weather statistics and a simple forecast, all updated in real time as the WeatherData
object acquires the most recent measurements.

Further, this is an expandable weather station. Weather-O-Rama wants to release an API so that other developers can write their
own weather displays and plug them right in. We'd like for you to supply that API!

Weather-O-Rama thinks we have a great business model: once the customers are hooked, we intend to charge them 
for each display they use. Now for the best part: we are going to pay you in stock options. 

We look forward to seeing your design and alpha application.

Sincerely,

Johhny Hurricane, CEO
PS: We are overnighting the WeatherData source files to you.
